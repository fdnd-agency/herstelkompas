## Client

**Zelfzorg aan Zee**

Zelfzorg aan Zee combines physical therapy, insightful exercises, and the power of water (Blue Mind Theory) to promote recovery. The program supports people with brain injuries, Long COVID, and burnout in improving both cognitive and physical functions.  

A medically specialized rehabilitation team collaborates with experienced patient advisors to guide participants until they can meaningfully contribute to society through work, volunteering, or achieving personal goals.  
The treatment program is only complete when the participant is satisfied with the outcome.

## Design Choices

We tried to match the colors from the “Zelfzorg aan Zee” website as closely as possible. However, the original yellow did not provide enough contrast with white text, so we replaced it with green in our design (adjustable as needed).  

We used rounded corners throughout the website for a friendly and approachable look, reflecting the waves of the sea.  

The left sidebar enables easy navigation between the Home, Bingokaart, Behandelingen, Scans, and Vragenlijst pages. On desktops, the sidebar is always visible; on tablets and mobile, it turns into a hamburger menu.

The **Bingokaart page** features an easy-to-use bingo card. Each square has a small circle in the top-left corner that fills when checked, and the square changes color (currently green) when completed.  

The **Behandelingen page** displays all treatments as stacked bars, each showing a description and date. An arrow on each bar indicates that the user can click for more information.

The **Treatment detail page** shows the status of the bingo card, scans, and vragenlijst for that date.

## Functionality Overview

### Libraries

#### SvelteKit

SvelteKit is a modern framework built on Svelte that simplifies web development. It handles routing, server-side rendering (SSR), data fetching, and build optimization. Its compile-time approach produces smaller, faster code compared to frameworks like React or Vue, making it suitable for both small and large applications.

#### @directus/sdk

`@directus/sdk` provides an easy interface to interact with the Directus API and can handle authentication for restricted actions.

### Components

#### Sidebar

Contains links to all pages with simple icons and doubles as a mobile menu. On screens ≤850px, it can be toggled open and closed.

#### Bingo Card

A dynamic component allowing users to check off goals. Each treatment saves its bingo card status; new entries are created if no treatment exists for the current day.

#### Treatments Page + Detail [TBD]

Displays an overview of all treatments. Users can view the bingo card, questionnaire, and scans for each treatment on a dedicated detail page.
